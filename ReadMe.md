# Intraday Market Activity Clustering: Insights from Macroeconomic Signals 📊💡

## Abstract 📝

Financial markets are complex systems shaped by multi-agent interactions of and
external factors, including geopolitical events and economic indicators. This study leverages
intraday data to identify patterns in market behavior, focusing on the evolving dynamics of
microstructure market states across distinct macroeconomic periods. Our findings emphasize
how different economic environments, such as periods of stability or crisis, influence the results
of market state detection models. This work provides a foundation for developing predictive
models that integrate external macroeconomic factors, enhancing the accuracy of forecasts and
the interpretability of market behavior for improved decision-making.

## Getting Started 🚀

Welcome to the **Intraday Market Activity Clustering** project! This repository contains the code and resources to help you reproduce the results from our research paper and explore clustering techniques applied to market data using macroeconomic signals.

### Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you start, you'll need to install a few dependencies:

You can install all required dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup 🏁

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-research.git`  
`cd clustering-research`

Make sure your environment is set up correctly and all dependencies are installed. Now you are ready to run the experiments and start exploring!

## Where to Find the Classes 🗂️

The core functionality of the clustering methods is organized into Python classes. You can find these in the `src/` directory:

- **Clustering:** Contains the implementations of various clustering methods.


You can explore each of these classes in their respective files.

## Run Experiments 🔬

NOTE: Data is available at https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/0X3Je6DauQRzD2r?path=%2FCAC40

To reproduce the experimental results from our research paper, simply run the `run_experiments.py` script. This script will process the data, apply the clustering algorithms, and output the results in the same way they appear in the paper.

### Usage 📥

`python run_experiments.py`

## Examples 💻

We’ve provided a set of Jupyter notebooks and scripts in the `examples/` directory to give you a hands-on guide for using the clustering methods in various real-world scenarios.

### Explore the following examples:

- **Example 1:** Clustering Intraday Market With Louvain
- **Example 2:** Clustering Intraday Market With PGA
- **Example 3:** Clustering Intraday Market With Random (Test purposes)

These notebooks will help you get a deeper understanding of how to apply the clustering methods to your own data, tweak the settings, and interpret the results.
